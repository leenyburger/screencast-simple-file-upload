## Getting started

# Adding your Simple File Upload API key
Sign up for a free trial at www.simplefileupload.com or through the [Heroku marketplace][https://elements.heroku.com/addons/simple-file-upload]

Replace the text in the `script` tag in `_head` with the provided API key. 

#Running your app
To run your app, use foreman start. Foreman will run Procfile.dev via foreman start -f Procfile.dev as configured by the .foreman file and will launch the development processes rails server, sidekiq, and webpack-dev-server processes.

You can also run them in separate terminals manually if you prefer.
